"# Stock_IexTrading_API" 
Create an app which has an Edit Text, Button and a TextView. The app will communicate with the API endpoint described below: https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/#quote  This API endpoint provides details on a company's stock based on its trading symbol (e.g: goog - Google, aapl - Apple, msft - Microsoft). The URL has the following schema: https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/SYMBOL/quote. So for the preceding examples, the respective URLs would be: https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/goog/quote https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/aapl/quote https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/msft/quote  The user should be able to enter a stock's symbol in the EditText, and upon pressing the Button, the app should communicate with the server to retrieve the corresponding data and the textview should display some details about the stock. The details are up to you to pick and choose from the response. Follow good coding practices.
